\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, we have put forth a solution to the problem of blockchain
interoperability that enables the communication between heterogeneous
blockchains functioning in either the proof-of-work or the proof-of-stake
model.

Our cryptographic primitives for proof-of-work are Non-Interactive Proofs
of Proof-of-Work, while for proof-of-stake we have constructed Proofs of
Proofs-of-Stake. Both constructions have applications beyond interoperability
in fast client synchronization, as well as light mining.

Our protocols have seen wide implementation in many top blockchains in
production and have given rise to many theoretical and practical follow-up
research works.
