\chapter{Proofs of Proof-of-Stake}\label{chapter:stake}

In this short chapter,
we abstract the notion of this trust transition into a new cryptographic
primitive called \emph{ad-hoc threshold multisignatures (ATMS)} that we
implement in three distinct ways. The first one simply concatenates signatures
of elected slot leaders. While secure, the disadvantage of this implementation
is that the size of the sidechain certificate is $\Theta(k)$ signatures. An
improvement can be achieved by employing multisignatures and Merkle-tree hashing
for verification key aggregation;  using this we can drop the
sidechain-certificate size to $\Theta(r)$ signatures where $r$  slot leaders do
not participate in its generation; in the optimistic case $r\ll k$ and thus this
scheme can be a significant improvement in practice. Finally, we show that
STARKs and bulletproofs~\cite{ben2017scalable,bulletproofs} can be used to bring
down the size of the certificate to be optimally succinct in the random oracle
model.  We observe that in the case of an active sidechain (e.g., one that
returns assets at least once per epoch) our construction with succinct sidechain
certificates has optimal storage requirements in the mainchain.

These ATMS will be leveraged in the next chapters to build full sidechains in
the proof-of-stake model.
