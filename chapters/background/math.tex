\section{Mathematical Background}
\subsection{The Chernoff Bound}

The following well-known theorem is due to
Rubin~\cite{chernoff1952measure,chernoff2014career}. It will help us derive
negligible bounds for probabilities of bad events.

\begin{theorem}[Chernoff Bounds]
  Let $\{X_i: i \in [n]\}$ be mutually independent Boolean random variables
  such that for all $i \in [n]$ it holds that $\Pr[X_i = 1] = p$. Let
  $X = \sum_{i = 1}^n X_i$ and $\mu = \Ex[X] = pn$. Then, for all
  $\delta \in (0, 1]$ it holds that:

  \[
    \Pr[X \leq (1 - \delta)\mu] \leq \exp(-\frac{\delta^2\mu}{2})
    \text{ and }
    \Pr[X \geq (1 + \delta)\mu] \leq \exp(-\frac{\delta^2\mu}{3})
  \]
\end{theorem}

A similar tail bound can be stated~\cite[Theorem~3.15]{mcdiarmid1998} for martingales.

\begin{theorem}[Martingale Tail]
\label{theorem:tailbound}
	Let $X_0,X_1,\dots$ be a martingale with respect to the sequence
	$Y_0,Y_1,\dots$.
	For $n\ge0$, let
	\[
		V=\sum_{i=1}^n\mathrm{var}(X_i-X_{i-1}|Y_0,\dots,Y_{i-1})
		\hbox{~and~}
		b=\max_{1\leq i\leq n}\sup(X_i-X_{i-1}|Y_0,\dots,Y_{i-1})
	,\]
	where sup is taken over all possible assignments to $Y_0,\dots,Y_{i-1}$.
	Then, for any $t,v\ge0$,
	\[\Pr\bigl[(X_n\ge X_0+t)\wedge(V\leq v)\bigr]\le\exp\biggl\{-\frac{t^2}{2v+2bt/3}\biggr\}.\]
\end{theorem}
