The Bitcoin Backbone protocol is illustrated in Algorithm~\ref{alg.backbone}.

\todo{Continuity}

Chains maintained by honest parties running the backbone protocol in an honest
majority setting satisfy the following three properties.

The \emph{chain growth} property states that the chain of an honest party will
keep growing at a certain rate $\tau$. Because honest parties always extend the
longest chain, this property holds even in executions of dishonest majority.

\begin{definition}[Chain Growth]\index{Chain Growth}
  An execution has \emph{chain growth} with parameters $\tau \in \mathbb{R}$
  (the \emph{chain velocity}) and $s \in \mathbb{N}$ (the \emph{chunk size}) if
  for all honest parties $\party$ and for all rounds $r$ the following holds. If
  $\party$ has adopted chain $\chain$ at round $r$, then for every round $r' > r
  + s$ the chain $\chain'$ adopted by $\party$ at round $r'$ satisfies:

  \[
  |\chain'| \geq |\chain| + \tau s
  \,.
  \]
\end{definition}

The \emph{chain quality} property states that any large enough ($\geq s$) chunk
of an honestly adopted chain will always contain some ($\rho$) honest blocks.

\begin{definition}[Chain Quality]\index{Chain Quality}
  An execution has \emph{chain quality} with parameters $\rho$ (the
  \emph{chain quality parameter}) and $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ (the \emph{chunk size})
  if for all honest parties $\party$ and for all rounds $r$ during which the
  party has adopted chain $\chain$ the following holds. For any $i, j$ such that
  $|\chain[i:j]| = \ell$, the block set $\chain' = \{B \in \chain[i{:}j]: B \text{
  was honestly generated}\}$ satisfies:

  \[
  \frac{|\chain'|}{\ell} \geq \rho
  \,.
  \]
\end{definition}

The \emph{common prefix} property states that the chains of two honest parties
cannot deviate much. In particular, they will share a large common prefix and
can only differ by up to $k$ blocks near their ends.

\begin{definition}[Common Prefix]\index{Common Prefix}
  An execution has \emph{common prefix} with parameter $k$ (the \emph{common
  prefix parameter}) if for all honest parties $\party_1, \party_2$ and rounds
  $r_1 \leq r_2$ the following holds. If $\party_1$ has adopted $\chain_1$
  during round $r_1$ and $\party_2$ has adopted $\chain_2$ during round $r_2$,
  then:

  \[
  \chain_1[{:}-k] \preceq \chain_2
  \,.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Impossibility of full semi-synchrony]
Revisiting the $\Delta$-bounded delay model, a folklore observation that has not appeared in
the litature is that blockchain protocols are impossible to obtain in the fully
semi-synchronous setting where \emph{no} conditions are imposed on $\Delta$,
because of the anonymous nature of the model. This impossibility stems from the
fact that $n$ is unknown to the honest parties. To see this, consider an
honest majority execution in which an adversary controls $t = (1 - \delta)(n -
t)$ parties for some $\delta > 0$. If the honest parties take a decision of
transaction acceptance within some time $\Delta$, then that $\Delta$ can be used
as network delay in which the messages of a percentage larger than $\delta$ of
the honest parties are delayed. That setting is then indistinguishable to the
honest parties from a setting in which the adversary controls the majority of
the parties $t > n - t$, as there is an honest percentage which is effectively
eclipsed. This is the case regardless of which solution is used to approach the
problem of consensus -- whether it is through blockchains or other means.
Standard dishonest majority attacks therefore become possible avenues to break
the protocol. Hence, the $\Delta$-bounded delay setting in which $\Delta$ is
unknown but some conditions are imposed on it is the best possible model we can
hope for, as further relaxation would not allow for a solution, as long as
dishonest majority breaks the protocol. The model can only be improved by
relaxing the conditions.
