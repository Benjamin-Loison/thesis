\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

The cryptographic treatment has three core characteristics~\cite{katz}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Formal definitions} play a central role. They specify the
        desirable properties of our protocols. As we will see, these can often
        be quite tricky to develop. One such example is the definition of
        \emph{pegging security} in Chapter~\ref{chapter:sidechains}.
  \item \textbf{Clearly articulated assumptions} allow us to understand the
        limitations of our protocols. Our protocols never work
        unconditionally, and we must restrict our model to obtain security. One
        such example is the computing power of the adversary. In the case of
        Chapter~\ref{chapter:work}, we can withstand a $1/3$ adversary, but the
        extended model of Chapter~\ref{chapter:variable} can only withstand a
        $1/4$ adversary.
  \item \textbf{Rigorous proofs of security} give us the \emph{guarantee} that
        our protocols are secure, as long as our assumptions hold. Instead of
        employing \emph{ad hoc} arguments, the proofs are mathematical theorems
        employing computational reductions, and they assert that the protocols
        are secure \emph{for all} adversaries.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter gives an overview of prerequisites upon which we build our
protocols. Blockchain science is a new field. As such, many of the elements we
employ here are folklore knowledge in the community, and some of them have never
been written down precisely before. Thus, this chapter may be of independent
interest as reference. Two interesting examples are our own security proof for
Merkle Trees, as well as an explicit description of the static difficulty,
variable difficulty, synchronous, and $\Delta$-bounded delay environments in the
form of pseudocode, which has previously only appeared in imprecise textual
descriptions.

\section{Cryptographic Primitives}

We now overview the cryptographic primitives we will make use of. In particular,
cryptographically secure hash functions, public-key signatures, and
proof-of-work. This section is a review. For a full
treatment, refer to any introductory textbook in the subject~\cite{katz,handbook,foundations1,foundations2}.

Blockchains are finite
block sequences obeying the \emph{blockchain property}: that in every block in
the chain there exists a pointer to its previous block. A chain is
\emph{anchored} if its first block is \emph{genesis}, denoted $Gen$.
Given chains $\chain_1, \chain_2$ and blocks $A, Z$ we concatenate them as
$\chain_1 \chain_2$ or $\chain_1 A$. $\chain_2[0]$ must point to $\chain_1[-1]$
and $A$ must point to $\chain_1[-1]$.
The \emph{id} function
returns the id of a block given its data, i.e., $\textsf{id} = H(ctr, G(x,
\textsf{interlink}))$.
