\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

The cryptographic treatment has three core characteristics~\cite{katz}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Formal definitions} play a central role. They specify the
        desirable properties of our protocols. As we will see, these can often
        be quite tricky to develop. One such example is the definition of
        \emph{pegging security} in Chapter~\ref{chapter:sidechains}.
  \item \textbf{Clearly articulated assumptions} allow us to understand the
        limitations of our protocols. Our protocols never work
        unconditionally, and we must restrict our model to obtain security. One
        such example is the computing power of the adversary. In the case of
        Chapter~\ref{chapter:work}, we can withstand a $1/3$ adversary, but the
        extended model of Chapter~\ref{chapter:variable} can only withstand a
        $1/4$ adversary.
  \item \textbf{Rigorous proofs of security} give us the \emph{guarantee} that
        our protocols are secure, as long as our assumptions hold. Instead of
        employing \emph{ad hoc} arguments, the proofs are mathematical theorems
        employing computational reductions, and they assert that the protocols
        are secure \emph{for all} adversaries.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter gives an overview of prerequisites upon which we build our
protocols. Blockchain science is a new field. As such, many of the elements we
employ here are folklore knowledge in the community, and some of them have never
been written down precisely before. Thus, this chapter may be of independent
interest as reference. Two remarkable examples are the security proof for
Merkle Trees, which to our knowledge has not been written down before, as well
as an explicit description of the static difficulty, variable difficulty,
synchronous, and $\Delta$-bounded delay environments in the form of pseudocode,
which has previously only appeared in imprecise textual descriptions.

\section{Cryptographic Primitives}

We now overview the cryptographic primitives we will make use of. In particular,
cryptographically secure hash functions, public-key signatures, and
proof-of-work. This section is a review. For a full
treatment, refer to any introductory textbook in the subject~\cite{katz,handbook,foundations1,foundations2}.

\section{Blockchain Protocols}

In our treatment, we deal with the \emph{consensus layer}\index{Consensus Layer}
of the protocol. Transactions are part of the
\emph{application layer}\index{Application Layer}. As we will not concern
ourselves about their format, we will allow the application layer to specify any
transaction format it wishes. Therefore, transactions can be any strings that
are deemed valid by the application layer.

\begin{definition}[Transaction]\index{Transaction}
  A predefined language $\mathcal{L}_{tx}$ of strings in $\{0, 1\}^*$ is called
  a \emph{transaction language}. Elements $tx \in \mathcal{L}_{tx}$ are called
  \emph{transactions}.
\end{definition}

While specific applications such as Bitcoin or Ethereum mandate that
transactions follow a certain format and must include, for example, signatures,
we will not impose such requirements on our protocol. As there are
preconceptions about what constitutes a transaction, we feel the need to give
some examples of transaction languages. The set of valid transactions could be
the empty set, the set of natural numbers, or the set of triplets of a message,
a public key, and a digital signature that pass verification under a certain
signature scheme. While the latter corresponds more closely to practical
protocols such as Bitcoin, our treatment is quite general and has no
requirements to remain within this strict format.

Once the set of valid transactions $\mathcal{L}_{tx}$ has been defined by the
application layer, it can now specify a \emph{validity language} which specifies
which \emph{sequences} of transactions are valid. This captures what is deemed
to be a valid transaction given a previous history of transactions in the
system and allows the application layer to specify, for example, that double
spending is not allowed.

\begin{definition}[Validity Language]\index{Validity Language}
  Given a transaction language $\mathcal{L}_{tx}$, a predifined set of finite
  transaction sequences $\ValLang \subseteq \mathcal{L}_{tx}^*$ is called its
  \emph{validity language}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Ledger]\index{Ledger}
\end{definition}

\begin{description}
  \item[Persistence.]\index{Persistence}
    For any two honest parties $\party_1,\party_2$ and two rounds $r_1\leq r_2$,
    it holds  $\LView{\Ledger}{\party_1}{r_1} \preceq
    \LView{\check{\Ledger}}{\party_2}{r_2}$.

  \item[Liveness.]\index{Liveness}
    If all honest parties in the system attempt to include a  transaction
    then, at any round $t$ after $u$ rounds (called the
    liveness parameter), any honest party $\party$, if queried,
    will report $\tx \in \LView{\Ledger}{\party}{r}$.
\end{description}


\subsection{Blockchain Backbone}
\todo{Restore old NIPoPoWs paper backbone overview section}

\todo{fix citations}\cite{backbone,pass-asynchronous,varbackbone}

\begin{remark}[Impossibility of full semi-synchrony]
Revisiting the $\Delta$-bounded delay model, a folklore observation that has not appeared in
the litature is that blockchain protocols are impossible to obtain in the fully
semi-synchronous setting where \emph{no} conditions are imposed on $\Delta$,
because of the anonymous nature of the model. This impossibility stems from the
fact that $n$ is unknown to the honest parties. To see this, consider an
honest majority execution in which an adversary controls $t = (1 - \delta)(n -
t)$ parties for some $\delta > 0$. If the honest parties take a decision of
transaction acceptance within some time $\Delta$, then that $\Delta$ can be used
as network delay in which the messages of a percentage larger than $\delta$ of
the honest parties are delayed. That setting is then indistinguishable to the
honest parties from a setting in which the adversary controls the majority of
the parties $t > n - t$, as there is an honest percentage which is effectively
eclipsed. This is the case regardless of which solution is used to approach the
problem of consensus -- whether it is through blockchains or other means.
Standard dishonest majority attacks therefore become possible avenues to break
the protocol. Hence, the $\Delta$-bounded delay setting in which $\Delta$ is
unknown but some conditions are imposed on it is the best possible model we can
hope for, as further relaxation would not allow for a solution, as long as
dishonest majority breaks the protocol. The model can only be improved by
relaxing the conditions.
\end{remark}
