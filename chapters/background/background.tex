\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

This chapter gives an overview of prerequisites upon which we build our
cross-chain protocols.

\section{Cryptographic Primitives}

We now overview the cryptographic primitives we will make use of. In particular,
cryptographically secure hash functions, public-key signatures, and
proof-of-work. Notably, similar to most blockchain protocols, we will not be
using any encryption or decryption. This section is a review. For a full
treatment, refer to any introductory textbook in the subject~\cite{katz,handbook,foundations1,foundations2}.

\begin{remark}[Impossibility of full semi-synchrony]
Revisiting the $\Delta$-bounded delay model, a folklore observation that has not appeared in
the litature is that blockchain protocols are impossible to obtain in the fully
semi-synchronous setting where \emph{no} conditions are imposed on $\Delta$,
because of the anonymous nature of the model. This impossibility stems from the
fact that $n$ is unknown to the honest parties. To see this, consider an
honest majority execution in which an adversary controls $t = (1 - \delta)(n -
t)$ parties for some $\delta > 0$. If the honest parties take a decision of
transaction acceptance within some time $\Delta$, then that $\Delta$ can be used
as network delay in which the messages of a percentage larger than $\delta$ of
the honest parties are delayed. That setting is then indistinguishable to the
honest parties from a setting in which the adversary controls the majority of
the parties $t > n - t$, as there is an honest percentage which is effectively
eclipsed. This is the case regardless of which solution is used to approach the
problem of consensus -- whether it is through blockchains or other means.
Standard dishonest majority attacks therefore become possible avenues to break
the protocol. Hence, the $\Delta$-bounded delay setting in which $\Delta$ is
unknown but some conditions are imposed on it is the best possible model we can
hope for, as further relaxation would not allow for a solution, as long as
dishonest majority breaks the protocol. The model can only be improved by
relaxing the conditions.
