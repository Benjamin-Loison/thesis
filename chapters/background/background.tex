\section{Cryptographic Primitives}

We now overview the cryptographic primitives we will make use of. In particular,
cryptographically secure hash functions, public-key signatures, and
proof-of-work. Notably, similar to most blockchain protocols, we will not be
using any encryption or decryption. This section is a review. For a full
treatment, refer to any introductory textbook in the subject~\cite{katz,handbook,foundations1,foundations2}.

\subsection{Hash Functions}
A hash function $H^s: \mathcal{M} \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is a function
parameterized by the security parameter $\lambda$ which takes any string from the distribution of input strings $\mathcal{M}$ and
outputs a string of constant size $\lambda$. To capture the fact that the hash
function behaves like a randomly chosen function, the hash
function is instantiated using a key-generating function
$\textsf{Gen}(1^\lambda)$ which generates a hash key $s$. The hash function itself is then $H^s$, a different function for each value of the key $s$. As hash functions are the building blocks and workhoses of cryptography, other protocols are designed on top of them that make use of them. We will do so in this work. In practice, the key $s$ is assumed to have been generated by the designers of the higher level protocol that makes use of the hash function and is typically fixed and publicly known. The hash protocol is the tuple $\Pi = (\textsf{Gen}, H)$.

Practical hash functions allow us to map any message $x$ of arbitrary length
$x \in \{0, 1\}^*$ to a fixed-length bitstring $\{0, 1\}^\lambda$. Hash
functions are easy to compute, but hard to invert. In applications, it is
assumed that a hash uniquely represents its preimage (it is \emph{binding}) and
that the preimage cannot be discovered from the image given sufficient entropy
(it is \emph{hiding}).

These intuitive ideas are captured by the difficulty of finding
collisions in hash functions. This is formalized in the next definition.

\input{./chapters/background/algorithms/alg.collision-resistance.tex}

\begin{definition}[Collision resistance]
  A hash function $H: \{0, 1\}^* \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is called
  \emph{collision resistant} if for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ there is a
  negligible function $\negl$ such that

  \[
  \Pr[\textsf{hash-collision}_{\Pi,\mathcal{A}} = 1] \leq \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

A weaker notion of security mandates that no adversary can reverse the function (pre-image resistance) or that no adversary can find a second value giving the same output as a given random value. The two cryptographic games and definitions are illustrated in Algorithms~\ref{alg.hash-preimage} and~\ref{alg.hash-second-preimage}.

\input{./chapters/background/algorithms/alg.hash-preimage.tex}
\input{./chapters/background/algorithms/alg.hash-second-preimage.tex}

\begin{definition}[Pre-image resistance]
  A hash function $H: \{0, 1\}^* \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is called
  \emph{pre-image resistant} if for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ there is a
  negligible function $\negl$ such that

  \[
  \Pr[\textsf{hash-preimage}_{\Pi,\mathcal{A}} = 1] \leq \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Second pre-image resistance]
  A hash function $H: \{0, 1\}^* \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is called
  \emph{second pre-image resistant} if for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$
  there is a negligible function $\negl$ such that

  \[
  \Pr[\textsf{hash-second-preimage}_{\Pi,\mathcal{A}} = 1] \leq \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

A hash function that is collision-resistant is also pre-image resistant; additionally, if it is pre-image resistant, then it must also be second pre-image resistant, as long as it provides sufficient compression~\cite{rogaway2004cryptographic}.

Protocols deployed in practice make use of fixed hash functions; that is, hash
functions with a fixed security parameter and a fixed key. In Bitcoin, the hash
function $\SHA$~\cite{sha256} is used for both commitments and proof-of-work.
Its domain and range are
$\SHA: \{0, 1\}^* \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^{256}$. In Ethereum, the hash
function $\keccak$~\cite{bertoni2008indifferentiability}, a variant of
$\texttt{SHA3}$, is used for commitments. Its domain and range are $\keccak: \{0, 1\}^*
\longrightarrow \{0, 1\}^{256}$. The function used for proof-of-work is a
variant of this.

\subsection{Signatures}
A \emph{digital signature} allows parties to authenticate the origin of a
message as well as its integrity~\cite{katz}. If Alice signs a message $m$, she generates a
signature $\sigma$ which is uniquely associated with that message. That
signature can then only be used to verify that particular message. In a secure signature scheme, an adversary
cannot \emph{forge} signatures that correctly verify for messages that have not
been signed by the honest party.

Signing and verification are two separate tasks which are asymmetric. Only the
authorized party can sign a message, but anyone can verify the signature. This
is achieved by having each party generate their own \emph{public-private
key pair} $(pk, sk)$ in which $pk$ is the public key and $sk$ is the secret key.
Signatures are then generated using the secret (or signing) key $sk$ and
verified using the public (or verification) key $sk$. A key pair is generated
using the polynomial-time key generation algorithm $(pk, sk) \gets
\Gen(1^\lambda)$. A signature is generated by invoking the polynomial-time
signing algorithm $\sigma = \Sig(sk, m)$. Verification is done by checking
whether the verification algorithm $\Ver(pk, m, \sigma)$ returns $\true$ or
$\false$. The signature scheme $\Pi$ then is defined as the tuple
$\Pi = (\Gen, \Sig, \Ver)$.

Signature schemes must be \emph{correct}.

\begin{definition}[Signature correctness]
  A signature scheme is \emph{correct} if there is a
  negligible function $\negl$ such that for all messages $m \in \{0, 1\}^*$ it
  holds that

  \[
    \Pr[(pk, sk) \gets \Gen(1^\lambda); \Ver(pk, m, \Sig(sk, m)) = \false] < \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

A \emph{secure} signature scheme requires that no adversary is able to forge
signatures. This is captured in the game-based definition of Algorithm~\ref{alg.forgery}. In this game, the challenger first generates a public/private key pair by invoking $\Gen(1^\lambda)$. Subsequently, the challenger asks the adversary $\mathcal{A}$ to attempt to find a signature forgery. The adversary is allowed to ask the challenger to have any messages signed by invoking the ${\Sig}O$ oracle with messages of her choice. The adversary is allowed to make multiple adaptive queries to the oracle. When the adversary is ready, she presents a message $m$, which she must not have requested from the oracle ${\Sig}O$ and a signature $\sigma$. The adversary is successful if the signature verifies.

\input{./chapters/background/algorithms/alg.forgery.tex}

\begin{definition}[Security]
  A signature scheme $\Pi = (\Gen, \Sig, \Ver)$ is \emph{secure} if for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ there is a negligible function $\negl$ such that

  \[
  \Pr[\textsc{sig-forge}_{\Pi,\mathcal{A}}(\lambda)] < \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

There are multiple ways to construct a secure signature scheme. Our signature schemes of interest make use of the \emph{discrete logarithm} problem in a group. In such a construction, a cyclic group $\mathbb{G}$ with order close to $2^\lambda$ and a generator $G \in \mathbb{G}$ are fixed initially. A public key corresponds to an element $A \in G$ of the group, while the corresponding private key $a \in \mathbb{Z}_{|\mathbb{G}|}$ is the order of $A$ with respect to $G$, that is $A = aG$. The keys are generated by first choosing a private key $a$ uniformly at random and then computing its corresponding public key. The public key can be computed quickly from the private key using multiplication by doubling~\cite{shoup}, but it is believed that the inverse problem is hard.

The problem of finding $a$ from $A$ is made formal in Algorithm~\ref{alg.dlog}. Here, we assume that an efficient algorithm $\mathcal{G}$ can be used to pick a suitable group of the appropriate order and output its description. Furthermore, we assume the group operator is efficiently computable. The challenger generates a group and chooses one of its elements at random. The adversary is then asked to find the \emph{discrete logarithm} of that element.

\input{./chapters/background/algorithms/alg.dlog.tex}

\begin{definition}[Discrete Logarithm Problem]
  The \emph{discrete logarithm problem} is hard in the family of groups $\{\mathcal{G}(1^\lambda)\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{N}}$ if for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$ there is a negligible function $\negl$ such that

  \[
    \Pr[\textsf{DLOG}_{\mathcal{G},\mathcal{A}}(\lambda) = 1] < \negl(\lambda)\,.
  \]
\end{definition}

The particular instantiation of signature schemes in the context of
cryptocurrencies makes use of elliptic curves~\cite{ec} in which the discrete logarithm problem is believed to be hard. More specifically, Bitcoin
and Ethereum both use the \texttt{secp256k1} curve~\cite{secp256k1}.

\begin{remark}
We remark that, perhaps contrary to popular belief, blockchain protocols
do not depend at all on encryption primitives. Therefore, we choose not to
treat encryption at all in the present work.
