We put forth the first decentralized communication mechanism
between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake blockchains, or combinations thereof.
To construct it, we propose two new cryptographic primitives
which function as cross-chain certificates. For proof-of-stake sources, the ATMS
primitive (Ad-Hoc Threshold Multisignatures) allows attesting to the shifting of
stake from epoch to epoch. For proof-of-work sources, the NIPoPoWs primitive
(Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work) allows compressing proof-of-work into
succinct strings that shrink a long blockchain into a succinct polylogarithmic
proof. We provide the first ATMS and NIPoPoWs constructions. For work, we prove
our constructions are secure in both the static and the variable difficulty
setting and we achieve security in the synchronous and bounded delay settings
with concrete adversary bounds in each case. We put forth the first definition
of sidechain security and formally prove our constructions secure. Our proofs
are in the Backbone model for work and in the Ouroboros model for stake.

Our cross-chain certificates allow the transmission of generic information
between blockchains. We describe multiple applications of our sidechains,
including proof-of-burn-based one-way pegs and two-way pegs.
In addition to interoperability, our protocols enable the transmission of
blockchain information for its own internal use. This allows the construction of
\emph{superlight} clients with exponentially smaller communication complexity
than traditional clients. These superlight clients are the first asymptotic
improvement upon SPV. Additionally, our protocols can be used in the work
setting to create \emph{superlight miners}, which need only logarithmic state
to mine and are an exponential improvement over standard proof-of-work
blockchain protocols. We demonstrate the feasibility of our schemes with
experiments, simulations, and implementations, including measurements of
security and performance metrics. We give concrete proposals for deployment
security parameters. We have worked with the industry to implement our schemes
in practice: Our protocols have been implemented and deployed in the real world
proof-of-work blockchains ERGO, nimiq, WebDollar, and Midnight and the
proof-of-stake blockchain Cardano.\\
