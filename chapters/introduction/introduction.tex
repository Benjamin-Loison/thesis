\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Superlight Clients}

\todo{continuity}

Given an honestly adopted chain, consensus security is based on the premise that
it is difficult to create a competing chain which deviates significantly and has
more proof-of-work than the existing honestly adopted chain. To determine which
financial history is the valid one, a \emph{verifier} node connected anew to the
network must download.

 convince a node
that a chain is the longest one, the proof-of-work of every block in the chain
must be presented and verified. This chain $\chain$ grows linearly with time.
The first problem we concern ourselves with

\todo{continuity}

Proof-of-work blockchain clients such as mobile wallets today are based on the
Simplified Payment Verifications (SPV) protocol, which was described in the
original Bitcoin paper~\cite{bitcoin}, and allows them to sychronize with the
network by downloading only block headers and not the entire blockchain with
transactions. However, such initial synchronization still requires receiving all
the block headers. In this work, we study the question of whether better
protocols exist and in particular if downloading fewer block headers is
sufficient to securely synchronize with the rest of the blockchain network. Our
requirement is that the system remains decentralized and that useful facts about
the blockchain (such as the Merkle root of current account balances in
Ethereum~\cite{wood,buterin}) can be deduced from the downloaded data.
