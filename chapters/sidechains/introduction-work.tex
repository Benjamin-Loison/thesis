\noindent\textbf{Our contributions. } In this paper, we introduce the first
trustless construction for proof-of-work sidechains. We describe how to build
generic communication between blockchains. As one application, we give the
construction of a \emph{two-way pegged} asset which can be moved from one
blockchain to another while retaining its nature. We provide a high-level
construction in Solidity. Our construction works across a broad range of
blockchains requiring only two underlying properties. First, that the
\emph{source} blockchain is a proof-of-work blockchain supporting
Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs), a cryptographic primitive
which allows constructing succinct proofs \emph{about} events which occur in a
proof-of-work blockchain and which was recently introduced in~\cite{nipopows}.
Support for NIPoPoWs can be introduced to practically any
work-based cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum without a hard or soft
fork. Second, that the \emph{target} blockchain is able to validate such proofs
through smart contracts such as, e.g., Ethereum or Ethereum
Classic.
We give a formal proof of security of our construction via
reduction to NIPoPoW security under the assumption that the interoperating
blockchains are secure individually.
To our knowledge, we are the first to
provide such a construction in
full and prove its security.
